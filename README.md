# Microgravity Games for Astronauts

## Overview
Imagine being an astronaut, floating through the vastness of space, while engaging in a series of games designed to entertain and sharpen your mind and body. We’ve created a collection of microgravity games that challenge you to enhance essential skills such as strength, reaction time, endurance, and relaxation. 

These games transform the unique conditions of space into a playground for growth, helping astronauts maintain fitness, focus, and connection. Beyond entertainment, the data collected from these games can be utilized to track and measure astronauts' mental and physical performance, ensuring they remain healthy and resilient during long missions—where well-being is critical for success.

## Mini-Games Overview

### Dolphin Game
**Objective:** Enhance conscious breathing through an interactive experience.

**Implementation:**
- **Breathing Measurement:** A wearable device monitors the astronaut's breathing rate in real-time.
- **User Interface:** Displays a dolphin swimming, indicating when to inhale (as it rises) and exhale (as it descends).
- **Feedback and Scoring:** Points awarded for matching breathing patterns to the dolphin's rhythm.
- **Data Analysis:** Processes data with Python, potentially visualizing patterns using Matplotlib.

**Skills Developed:**
- Breath control
- Mindfulness
- Relaxation techniques
- Emotional regulation

### Curling Game
**Objective:** Combine skill with heart rate management in a multiplayer setting.

**Implementation:**
- **Camera Setup:** Monitors ball positions and player actions using OpenCV and heart rate sensors.
- **Game Mechanics:** Players take turns throwing balls; heart rate monitoring invalidates turns if thresholds are exceeded.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Python processes camera data to calculate distances and manage turns.
- **Scoring System:** Points awarded based on accuracy and heart rate management.

**Skills Developed:**
- Coordination
- Precision
- Stress management
- Social interaction
- Decision-making

### Memory Game
**Objective:** Improve memory skills in an engaging manner.

**Implementation:**
- **Grid Display:** Squares briefly flash before hiding, challenging players to remember their locations.
- **User Interaction:** Players click on squares they remember, with time tracked for each attempt.
- **Data Management:** Python handles game logic, randomizes squares, and tracks clicks using Pygame.
- **Scoring System:** Points awarded based on accuracy and speed.

**Skills Developed:**
- Memory enhancement
- Concentration
- Cognitive agility
- Problem-solving

### Reaction Time Game
**Objective:** Challenge players’ reflexes with visual stimuli.

**Implementation:**
- **Visual Stimuli:** Displays a grid with "good" (green) and "bad" (red) boxes that appear quickly.
- **User Interaction:** Players click only the green boxes while avoiding red ones.
- **Speed Variation:** Difficulty increases as boxes appear more frequently and for shorter durations.
- **Data Management:** Python tracks reaction times and accuracy.
- **Scoring System:** Points awarded for correct clicks, with deductions for errors.

**Skills Developed:**
- Reaction time
- Hand-eye coordination
- Focus
- Decision-making
